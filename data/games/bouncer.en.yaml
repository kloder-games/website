  This game will put your reflexes to the test, don't lose sight of the platforms and let the rhythm guide your hand or you'll end up falling into the void.

  A different way of playing, control the terrain instead of the character and take care not to let him fall into the void, for this you can help you from different types of platforms, some will transform you into fire, others change the sense of the game and care, some will make you lose points. With infinite levels and difficulty increasing level by level, where will you be able to reach?
